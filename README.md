# Valorant 
This is a website that utilizes the middleman I've created to talk to the Valorant servers. It gives you shop information and player info.

## Version 2.0
This was a pretty small update. 

+ The shop will now load faster, we store the shop in local storage until it resets.
+ Favicon support for all devices
+ Removed old react favicons


#### What to look out for 3.0
The next update will include hopefully reauth if I can get it working. I have plans to increase the load time for the whole site, but it's not the top priority. I wish to include a menu where you can view more information about the guns in your shop. Currently, you cannot view the bundle in the shop but that will be coming soon.

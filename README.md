# Valorant Server
This is a api for my current project, it works as the midddle man and does all the requests to the Valorant servers meanwhile my website just makes calls to this.  

### Why?
It helps keep the code clean and not a mess and it's easier to read. I also only get the data I need so I don't have to fliter through which can take time.
